											<div class="row">
												<div class="col-10 col-30-small">
													<ol>
														<li>As per the Instacart Grocery analysis, it was concluded that weekends were the most busiest days when customers visited the site and Tuesday & Wednesday were the slowest. Hence the sales team should focus on busiest & the slowest days to schedule ads in order to improve their ad campaigns.

														</li>
														<li>The busiest hour of the day when maximum orders were placed was between 9am to 5pm. As the stakeholders are looking to improve the performance, they should target these peak hours for their ad campaigns.

														</li>
														<li>Early morning from 2am to 10am was considered to be the busiest time when most of the order was placed by the customers. The sales team should target those early morning hours to improve there marketing.
														</li>
														<li>It was also concluded that the most propular products were people spend their money was Icecream Bars, grapes, Soda, Butter and Cookies. The sales team should look into these product as why there was more demand for only these products and target their ad campaigns more on these products as they were the most popular.
														</li>
														<li>Region and customer status made no difference to the spending. Although it was very clear from the analysis that average income category of the customers were the most frequent visitors of Instacart. The sales team should focus on the young adult high income group which almost never visited the Instacart and the young adults low income group who significantly contributed a good proportion of their spending
